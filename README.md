# CHAT APP


In this mini project I want to show you a chat app that I made. Although the visual structure is simple, what I want to highlight is the functionality with firebase. It works 100% and is stable with the minimum configuration of the database.


## This application contains:
* Basic error handling like "@" ".com" "minimum characters".
* Firebase integration.
* Active notifications.
* Integration of the active camera and collection of information.
